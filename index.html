            <h2>Meet Saranya</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Saranya Senthilkumar, founder of TwinsAtPlay. My journey began with my twin sister Pavi, who has autism. Watching her grow, I realized the profound impact of friendship and understanding on a child's development.</p>
            <h3>Why We Started TwinsAtPlay:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Create a safe, inclusive space for all children</li>
                <li>Connect families for meaningful playdates</li>
                <li>Promote empathy and awareness in our community</li>
                <li>Ensure every child experiences the joy of friendship</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Through my experiences with Pavi, I saw firsthand the challenges children with autism face in social situations. I also witnessed the beautiful moments of connection when understanding and acceptance were present. This inspired me to create TwinsAtPlay, a platform that bridges the gap and creates opportunities for all children to play, learn, and grow together.</p>
